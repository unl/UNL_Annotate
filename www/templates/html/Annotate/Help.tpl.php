<h1>UNL Annotation Help</h1>
<p>Annotations are your personal notes. After logging in, you can save notes
for specific content areas around the UNL website. These notes will only
be viewable by you.</p>
<p>For example, you can save the spouse's name for a person within the
<a href="http://directory.unl.edu/">UNL directory</a>.</p>
<p>Remember to log out of the My.UNL single sign on service when your session
has ended.</p>
